### Summary

This is a collection of info about PEI's electric school buses.

* PEI's electric school buses make a chime. I believe the notes are: F#, B, F#
* Weird: the little motif appears in the Rush guitar solo near 2m52s [1]
* same as the current Montreal Metro chime [2]

It turns out the contemporary Montreal Metro chime has ties to another generation. One of 
the cars (the MR-73) would make a chime upon acceleration (see [4] for details). This chime might be quoted at the very start of this commercial jingle [3]. I believe the notes are: F, Bb, F, which is supported by [6].

The article at [4] makes the case that the old chime might be a nod to Expo 67 and Aaron Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man. This also appears in Wikipedia [7]. However, [8] disputes that, using text allegedly from "the STM".
